        <h2>Introduction to Xamarin Designer for iOS (IOS102)</h2>
<p>It is challenging to create a UI that looks good and works well on multiple devices with different screen sizes and different pixel densities. IOS handles this using the concept of constraints. Instead of giving fixed sizes and positions, you specify relationships such as &quot;align these two views vertically&quot; or &quot;stretch this view to fit all the available space&quot;. This course first shows you how to use constraints to layout the views on a single screen. It then broadens the discussion to show you how to use segues to link together multiple pages in your app. </p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="parts/part1.html">Exercise 1: Create and lay out a single view application</a>
<br>
<p>The primary goal of this lab is to teach you how to create a new iOS application and add a basic UI using the iOS Designer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part2.html">Exercise 2: Use Auto Layout in your application</a>
<br>
<p>The primary goal of this exercise is to teach you how to update your Fireworks application to use constraints to size and position your views relative to the view controller. The finished UI will look something like this:</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part3.html">Exercise 3: Add behavior to the UI</a>
<br>
<p>The primary goal of this lab is to add behavior to your views using the View Controller's code behind. The finished UI should look something like this:</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part4.html">Exercise 4: Add a second screen and navigation</a>
<br>
<p>The primary goal of this lab will be to add a second View Controller to the storyboard design surface and display it programmatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part5.html">Exercise 5: Add segues to define the navigation</a>
<br>
<p>The primary goal of this lab is to teach you how to display a second View Controller using segues. The finished storyboard should look something like this:</p>
</li>
